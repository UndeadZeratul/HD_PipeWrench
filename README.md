    "Wait...why do people carry this? Where did they even get it from?
    This wrench is supposed to be used by our construction crew, not mercs and marines. We don't even
    offer them the ability to purchase it!
    Oh well, i supposed hitting demons over the head with this will surely make them see stars.
    If that's the case, we should probably just offer it for anyone willing to use it in combat."
